# Python for Data Analysis

This repo contains the code samples of the book Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython 2nd Edition (https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=Learning+pandas&qid=1555936735&s=gateway&sr=8-8).

The book looks into the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. My goal is to offer a guide to the parts of the Python programming language and its data-oriented library ecosystem and tools that will equip you to become an effective data analyst. While 'data analysis' is in the title of the book, the focus is specifically on Python programming, libraries, and tools as opposed to data analysis methodology. This is the Python programming you need for data analysis.
